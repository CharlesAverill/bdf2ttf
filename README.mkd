# Font file conveter BDF to TTF

bdf2ttf converts font files in BDF which is bitmap font to a TrueType Font
(TTF) format file.  bdf2ttf use TTF's embedded bitmap font feature for
conversion.  So conversion time is very short, and result TTF will be very
small.  But embedded bitmap font is side depended, when you it use with
different size, you would get dusty rendering.
